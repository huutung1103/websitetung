<div id="before-college" class="section level2">
<h2>Before college:</h2>
<p>My name is Tung and I come from <strong>Vietnam</strong>. When I was in high school, I thought that I would become a professional basketball player but I didn’t <em>grow any inches during high school</em>. That was when I decided to go study abroad in the <strong>U.S.</strong></p>

<h2>During college:</h2>
<p>I chose <a href="https://www.temple.edu/">Temple University</a> because the university was generous enough to give me a full scholarship. At first, I didn’t know what I wanted to do so I tried a bit of everything: consulting club, case competitions, studying abroad in Seoul at <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/95/YonseiUniversityEmblem.svg/1200px-YonseiUniversityEmblem.svg.png" alt="Yonsei University" />, interning at a technology start-up in London. However, after I joined the university investment fund, I got exposure to investment banking and decided that I wanted to work in the space.</p>

<h2>Banking internship:</h2>
<p>I didn’t succeed with recruiting for banking in the U.S., so I returned home and joined two investment banks in two consecutive summers to learn more about the job and experience the fast-paced environment:</p>

<li>Maybank Kim Eng Securities</li>
<li>Viet Capital Securities</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks to this experience, I not only learned how to execute different tasks including modeling, creating teasers, compiling pitchbooks but also worked closely with my seniors to see how you executed a deal.</p>

<h2>London Business School:</h2>
<p>Because the deal activity in Vietnam is not as robust as in a developed financial center, I decided to join London Business School with a hope of getting a job in London. I believe that with LBS’s extensive alumni network and experienced career center, along with my hard work and knowledge, I will be able to secure an offer after the program.</p>
