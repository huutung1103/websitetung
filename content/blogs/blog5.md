## Before college:
My name is Tung and I come from **Vietnam**. When I was in high school, I thought that I would become a professional basketball player but I didn't *grow any inches during high school*. That was when I decided to go study abroad in the **U.S.**

## During college:
I chose [Temple University](https://www.temple.edu/) because the university was generous enough to give me a full scholarship. At first, I didn't know what I wanted to do so I tried a bit of everything: consulting club, case competitions, studying abroad in Seoul at ![Yonsei University](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/95/YonseiUniversityEmblem.svg/1200px-YonseiUniversityEmblem.svg.png), interning at a technology start-up in London. However, after I joined the university investment fund, I got exposure to investment banking and decided that I wanted to work in the space. 

## Banking internship:
I didn't succeed with recruiting for banking in the U.S., so I returned home and joined two investment banks in two consecutive summers to learn more about the job and experience the fast-paced environment:

1. Maybank Kim Eng Securities
2. Viet Capital Securities

Thanks to this experience, I not only learned how to execute different tasks including modeling, creating teasers, compiling pitchbooks but also worked closely with my seniors to see how you executed a deal. 

## London Business School: 
Because the deal activity in Vietnam is not as robust as in a developed financial center, I decided to join London Business School with a hope of getting a job in London. I believe that with LBS's extensive alumni network and experienced career center, along with my hard work and knowledge, I will be able to secure an offer after the program.
