      <description>If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere at NASAâ€™s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here
To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

      <description>Before college: My name is Tung and I come from Vietnam. When I was in high school, I thought that I would become a professional basketball player but I didn&amp;rsquo;t grow any inches during high school. That was when I decided to go study abroad in the U.S.
During college: I chose Temple University because the university was generous enough to give me a full scholarship. At first, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what I wanted to do so I tried a bit of everything: consulting club, case competitions, studying abroad in Seoul at , interning at a technology start-up in London.</description>
